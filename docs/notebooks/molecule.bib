	abstract = {Reliable infrared (IR) line lists are reported for the 13 isotopologues of carbon dioxide in HITRAN notation: 626, 636, 628, 627, 828, 727, 827, 638, 637, 737, 838, 738, and 646. Three IR lists are available for each istotopologue: a complete list at 296K, a reduced-size list at 296K, plus a reduced-size list at 1000K. They are denoted Ames-296K, Ames-296K.reduced and Ames-1000K.reduced. With J up to 150, and energy up to 18,000cm−1 above the zero point energy, these lists are expected to cover the temperature range up to 1500K. Line shape parameters including temperature dependence are calculated and reported for four temperature ranges: Mars, Earth, Venus, and Hotter (700–2000K). Comparisons are made against the available transition data in the HITRAN2012 models. Line position accuracy for most transitions up to 10,000–13,000cm−1 is better than 0.03–0.05cm−1. Computed transition intensities agree well with most HITRAN data but there exist suspicious exceptions for isotopologues. These line lists will expedite CO2 IR experimental data analysis and provide the scientific community with trustworthy alternatives for unknown IR bands. These line lists may be combined with existing experimental databases to facilitate the analysis of future laboratory experiments or astronomical observations.}

The collected data were used to create semi-empirical models so that every HITRAN line of the studied molecules has corresponding parameters. Since H2 and He are major constituents in the atmospheres of gas giants, and CO2 predominates in atmospheres of some rocky planets with volcanic activity, these spectroscopic data are important for remote sensing studies of planetary atmospheres. In this paper we make the first step in assembling complete sets of these parameters, thereby creating datasets for SO2, NH3, HF, HCl, OCS and C2H2.}

The 1s, 2s and 2p states of hydrogen together with three pseudostates have been employed in the eigenfunction expansion. The results have been found to be in good agreement with other calculations and are believed to be currently the most accurate available.}
