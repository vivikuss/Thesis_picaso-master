This line list, called 10to10, contains 9.8 billion transitions and should be complete for temperatures up to 1500 K. It covers the wavelengths longer than 1 μm and includes all transitions to upper states with energies below hc · 18 000 cm−1 and rotational excitation up to J = 39. The line list is computed using the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of CH4 obtained by variational solution of the Schrödinger equation for the rotation–vibration motion of nuclei employing program trove and a new ‘spectroscopic’ potential energy surface (PES) obtained by refining an ab initio PES (CCSD(T)-F12c/aug-cc-pVQZ) through least-squares fitting to the experimentally derived energies with J = 0-4 and a previously reported ab initio dipole moment surface (CCSD(T)-F12c/aug-cc-pVTZ). Detailed comparisons with other available sources of methane transitions including HITRAN, experimental compilations and other theoretical line lists show that these sources lack transitions both higher temperatures and near-infrared wavelengths. The 10to10 line list is suitable for modelling atmospheres of cool stars and exoplanets. It is available from the CDS data base as well as at www.exomol.com.}",

Three IR lists are available for each istotopologue: a complete list at 296K, a reduced-size list at 296K, plus a reduced-size list at 1000K. They are denoted Ames-296K, Ames-296K.reduced and Ames-1000K.reduced. With J up to 150, and energy up to 18,000cm−1 above the zero point energy, these lists are expected to cover the temperature range up to 1500K. Line shape parameters including temperature dependence are calculated and reported for four temperature ranges: Mars, Earth, Venus, and Hotter (700–2000K). Comparisons are made against the available transition data in the HITRAN2012 models. Line position accuracy for most transitions up to 10,000–13,000cm−1 is better than 0.03–0.05cm−1. Computed transition intensities agree well with most HITRAN data but there exist suspicious exceptions for isotopologues. These line lists will expedite CO2 IR experimental data analysis and provide the scientific community with trustworthy alternatives for unknown IR bands. These line lists may be combined with existing experimental databases to facilitate the analysis of future laboratory experiments or astronomical observations."

	abstract = {Vienna atomic line database (VALD) is a collection of critically evaluated laboratory parameters for individual atomic transitions, complemented by theoretical calculations. VALD is actively used by astronomers for stellar spectroscopic studies—model atmosphere calculations, atmospheric parameter determinations, abundance analysis etc. The two first VALD releases contained parameters for atomic transitions only. In a major upgrade of VALD—VALD3, publically available from spring 2014, atomic data was complemented with parameters of molecular lines. The diatomic molecules C2, CH, CN, CO, OH, MgH, SiH, TiO are now included. For each transition VALD provides species name, wavelength, energy, quantum number J and Landé-factor of the lower and upper levels, radiative, Stark and van der Waals damping factors and a full description of electronic configurarion and term information of both levels. Compared to the previous versions we have revised and verify all of the existing data and added new measurements and calculations for transitions in the range between 20 Å and 200 microns. All transitions were complemented with term designations in a consistent way and electron configurations when available. All data were checked for consistency: listed wavelength versus Ritz, selection rules etc. A new bibliographic system keeps track of literature references for each parameter in a given transition throughout the merging process so that every selected data entry can be traced to the original source. The query language and the extraction tools can now handle various units, vacuum and air wavelengths. In the upgrade process we had an intensive interaction with data producers, which was very helpful for improving the quality of the VALD content.}

The collected data were used to create semi-empirical models so that every HITRAN line of the studied molecules has corresponding parameters. Since H2 and He are major constituents in the atmospheres of gas giants, and CO2 predominates in atmospheres of some rocky planets with volcanic activity, these spectroscopic data are important for remote sensing studies of planetary atmospheres. In this paper we make the first step in assembling complete sets of these parameters, thereby creating datasets for SO2, NH3, HF, HCl, OCS and C2H2.}

This line list, called SAlTY, contains almost 16.8 billion transitions between 7.5 million energy levels and it is suitable for simulating spectra up to temperatures of 1500 K. It covers wavelengths longer than 1 μm and includes all transitions to upper states with energies below hc × 18 000 cm−1 and rotational excitation up to J = 46. The line list is computed by variational solution of the Schrödinger equation for the rotation–vibration motion employing the nuclear-motion program trove. A previously reported ab initio dipole moment surface is used as well as an updated ‘spectroscopic’ potential energy surface, obtained by refining an existing ab initio surface through least-squares fitting to the experimentally derived energies. Detailed comparisons with other available sources of phosphine transitions confirms SAlTY's accuracy and illustrates the incompleteness of previous experimental and theoretical compilations for temperatures above 300 K. Atmospheric models are expected to severely underestimate the abundance of phosphine in disequilibrium environments, and it is predicted that phosphine will be detectable in the upper troposphere of many substellar objects. This list is suitable for modelling atmospheres of many astrophysical environments, namely carbon stars, Y dwarfs, T dwarfs, hot Jupiters and Solar system gas giant planets.

	journal = {Physica Scripta},
	abstract = {Vienna atomic line database (VALD) is a collection of critically evaluated laboratory parameters for individual atomic transitions, complemented by theoretical calculations. VALD is actively used by astronomers for stellar spectroscopic studies—model atmosphere calculations, atmospheric parameter determinations, abundance analysis etc. The two first VALD releases contained parameters for atomic transitions only. In a major upgrade of VALD—VALD3, publically available from spring 2014, atomic data was complemented with parameters of molecular lines. The diatomic molecules C2, CH, CN, CO, OH, MgH, SiH, TiO are now included. For each transition VALD provides species name, wavelength, energy, quantum number J and Landé-factor of the lower and upper levels, radiative, Stark and van der Waals damping factors and a full description of electronic configurarion and term information of both levels. Compared to the previous versions we have revised and verify all of the existing data and added new measurements and calculations for transitions in the range between 20 Å and 200 microns. All transitions were complemented with term designations in a consistent way and electron configurations when available. All data were checked for consistency: listed wavelength versus Ritz, selection rules etc. A new bibliographic system keeps track of literature references for each parameter in a given transition throughout the merging process so that every selected data entry can be traced to the original source. The query language and the extraction tools can now handle various units, vacuum and air wavelengths. In the upgrade process we had an intensive interaction with data producers, which was very helpful for improving the quality of the VALD content.}
